This site is an unofficial solutions guide for the exercises in *An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. You can grab a free pdf of the book from the [official site](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) or you can purchase a physical copy from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370) or [Springer](http://www.springer.com/statistics/statistical+theory+and+methods/book/978-1-4614-7137-0).

Code excerpts are inlined in the solution guide for each chapter but you can get the source code from the [Github repository](https://github.com/athind94/ISL-Solutions) too. If you spot any errors feel free to issue a pull request!
